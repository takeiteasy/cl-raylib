# cl-raylib
Common Lisp binding of [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

## basic example
1. install raylib

cl-raylib require raylib dynamic library

run `brew install raylib` to install the library if run example on macOS

or run `build.sh` or `build.bat` to build raylib locally

2. install `cffi`

cl-raylib use cffi to load dynamic library

`quicklisp` can install cffi automatically, or installing cffi with system package manager is also ok

3. fetch cl-raylib code

cl-raylib is not on quicklisp now, so you should fetch it manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/longlene/cl-raylib.git ~/.quicklisp/local-projects/cl-raylib
```
my quicklisp install path is ~/.quicklisp

clone to ~/.local/share/common-lisp/source/cl-raylib is ok if you has no quicklisp

4. run basic example

enter sbcl repl (or ccl etc) :blush:
```bash
sbcl --load ~/.quicklisp/local-projects/cl-raylib/examples/basic.lisp --quit
```
Press `ESC` to close the basic window
